    <p class="max-w-2xl text-lg mb-6">
      In the hush of a village cloaked in shadows, where dreams were often silenced before they could speak, a spark was born. 
      That spark became a fire, carrying him across continents, languages, and expectations... all the way to the soaring promise of America. 
      This memoir is equal parts heartbreak and hope—a portrait of the immigrant experience that is deeply personal and universally human.
